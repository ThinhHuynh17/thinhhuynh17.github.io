<h2> Interest in IT </h2>


    <ul>

        <li> My interest in IT started with: "If there's anyone can change the world, that would be a software developer.".
Keeping it in my 8 year-old mind, I was curious how software developers can do that. By learning, searching and experiencing
from many online courses, I finally came to a conclusion that they actually can do that. Growing up a bit, I was lucky enough
to have a ticket to a tech talk and the topic was "How to learn AI as a beginner", the event was organized by TopDev and it was
fascinating and so curious to know what AI can do in our life. And that event sparked my inspiration to become a software developer. I realized that there are so
many things I can do with a computer and a lab, I can create many apps which improve our daily live. And it would be greater
if I can apply AI and machine learning, which I know it really requires a very advanced amount of knowledge to fully understand about it. But overall,
becoming a software developer has always been my dream, and I will surely work hard for what I have been dreaming about.</li>
<p></p>

        <li> Before apply to RMIT, I have been looking throught many other universities such as FPT, Hutech or Bach Khoa. But then I just knew that none of those universites would
not work for me. What I looked for was a fully English speaking environment, excellent facility and well rated professors.
Therefore, I spent about 1 months get to know about RMIT SGS Campus, and I found out that RMIT has all what I was looking for. I participated in orientations,
had a look at academic calendar and had many meetings with my advisor to surely know that I would perform good in this univeristy. Until now, I think I was right
when I decided to apply to RMIT, good education, be able to learn about what I love to do and good environment to live in.</li>
<p></p>

        <li> When I first started this bachelor, I expected that when I finished my studies, I can perform what I have learnt excellent as a prove
I studied diligently, so that I can find a company who can accpet me and train me more for my future career. Moreover, not just about the knowledge that I
acquire from the whole study progress, one thing I desire to have is communication skill. Although improving my knowledge is important, but I think
communication is a soft skill that will significantly change my life in the future. Those two are my main expectation when I came to study at
this university, though there will be more as I progress and learn more.</li>

    </ul>

<h2> Ideal Job </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Job Advertisement: <a href=' https://jobs.intel.com/page/show/software-jobs-software-development-engineer'> Intel Software Development Engineer </a></li>
        <li>This job is to work with hardware and software to give out applications that operate in real time, the RTOS. The appealing part of this job to me is that the topic
of the output of this job is very various, which needs a decent creativity and knowledge to make that output becomes a real application.        </li>
        <li>This position requires at least Bachelor Degree (for Low-Level Development) and Master for High-Level Development. This job also needs experience in many programming
languages such as C##, C+, Python, HTML, Java and operating systems like Linux, Windows, Cloud. There are skills that will be significantly helpful for this job, for instance,
communication skill, logical thinking, creative thinking and teamwork.</li>
        <li>In my perspective, I do not know many programming languages except Python and a little bit of C. I am currently studying a Bachelor Degree and planning to have
a Master Degree, too. I also have little experience working with arduino programming.</li>
        <li>With my current experience, I plan to continue my study for a Master Degree while working at comapnies like FPT to gain more experience. After studying Master and
and also have a good amount of knowledge about programming, I will learn more about machine learning and AI and try to apply to a company that works with those things to gain
more experience. When I feel that I have a decent knowledge, I will apply to Intel.</li>

    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In my opinion, these tests results tell me that I can work imaginative and creatively, also I can synergy well with other people in a team. I also
can learn very well and fast if I learn it through doing it or seeing it, which will make my brain memorize it quickly and longer. My imaginative and creative mind can
give out many ideas that useful in real life, but in order to make it becomes applications, I need myself to be realistic.        </li>
        <li>If I work as a member of a team, I can be easy going with other members, also kind and patient. I see myself as someone who can sympathy with other people.
It does not challenging at all when it comes to an arguement in our team, I believe I can be fair and decisive to give out the right decision. I personally think that with
me in a team, there will be no problem at all, we can be friends and have very good connection between each others, which is a perfect working environemtn for me.        </li>
        <li>When forming a team, the first thing I should do is to get to know every members of my team. Therefore, when I know them well, I can help avoid making them
feel uncomfortable and stressful. To me, knowing a person is very important, that can helps me know his strenght and weekness so that we can always do what we do best. Moreover,
I will need to avoid lazy and arrogant people, I just can not start any conversation with those people, and that will slow the whole team down.        </li>
    </ul>

<h1> Project Ideas </h1>
    <p>For a long time, I have been interested in applications that can interact with people and can operate itself. Therefore, in the future, my innovative
        project would be creating a complex system which you can remotely control your house functions such as lightning, air conditioning, security, basically, everything in
        your house includes cleaning and can be completely automatic. Moreover, the system will have some functions that are connected to your country public services such as
        police, hospitals, fire centers. Above all of that, the greatest thing about this system is there will be only one company who provides this service to you so therefore
        your information can be protected and united safely, avoiding information lacking or being stolen    </p>
    <p>In real life, the world is getting modern and modern, the consequences of that progress are also getting complicated and sophisticated. With this reliable system,
        you can freely customize your own home simply using an app on your phone or your laptop. Moreover, it helps you do almost everything, let you have more time with
        your family and your business. This system also protects you from being stolen with its biometric security system. In emergency cases, you can call police or ambulance
        faster with built-in functions and they will get to you faster by using this service. After all, the purpose of this system is to make your life easier and more
        comfortable, become a truly home where you do not have to think about housework or worry about being threatened.</p>
    <p>People will be very tired and frustrated after a long day at work, and they tend to want things to get ready when they arrive home. Following the aforementioned functions
        and its conveniences in the previous paragraph, I would like to name this application "SmartLife". To be more specific, it will be able to control the systems in your
        house once it connects to the internet. First of all, what you need to do is authorizing "SmartLife" to access the controls, and set up a 6-digit password, and your
        biometrics. There will be specific switches of the lights on each floor or room in your house, the air conditioning, the security cameras, the automatic cleaning machines,
        and even the water heating system. You can also set timers for these remoting controls to turn on or off in case you are too busy. Besides the main functions of turning on
        and off the switches, "SmartLife" can also automatically pay your monthly electricity bill or water bill. To activate that, all you need to do is to fill in the card
        numbers and your full name. Furthermore, there are also buttons for you to contact the local hospitals, police stations, fire stations, etc., in case you have an emergency.
        This works with the automatic locating system on your phone, or you can manually set this up if your address is located elsewhere and inaccurate. Also, there will be
        systems set up around your house to detect the current status; and in case there is an emergency and you cannot reach your phone, after 30 seconds to 1 minute without any
        manual controls, the report of your current situation will be sent to the nearest place and ask for help. Another special function is that you can set up your house's
        security and check that on your phone at any time of the day, and this includes the cameras, the password lock on your doors. The security will work with your biometrics,
        and signals can only be sent from your phone or your authorized partner's. Therefore, all of your confidential information is strictly managed, which can only be accessed
        by your biometrics or those with great authority in the company. Any suspicious attempts of breaking into your house or stealing your information will be notified to you
        immediately and the thicker security layer will also be activated. Furthermore, "SmartLife" can also work well with any other electronic devices, such as loudspeakers,
        televisions, vacuuming robots, etc., and even other applications on your phone. For example, you can turn on Netflix on your television, or playing music from Spotify on
        your loudspeakers by connecting your phone and your devices, then just simply make the choices on your phone, and then the devices will work as you please. If you do not
        want to manually do all the daily controls, you can set up a schedule of all the things you need on the application. Even if there is no internet connection or your phone
        is on low battery, the functions will still follow your schedule normally.</p>
    <p>The main operating system here is Linux due to its low cost, security, flexibility, reliability and stability. Moreover, Apache Mynewt will be the main open source for this
        system, the reasons are this system can operate devices in terms of long period and memory storage. Currently, the testing prototypes are based on Arduino programming.</p>
    <p>There are a range of skills and experience that needed for this project. First of all, it requires a very wide knowledge of programming languages, hardware, software,
        operating systems, machine learning and AI. Obviously, this is a project for High-Level and experienced developers. But beside that, there will be less hard jobs in this
        project, such as programming interactive apps on user’s phone and laptop so that they can control the system remotely through wifi. Depends on the job position, finding
        the right skills for this project is pretty hard due to its very advanced level, but for the software and hardware, it will not be very hard, just moderate level because
        these things are very various on the market, they just need to be selected.</p>
    <p>If the project is successful, the daily life of many people can be easier, more comfortable, and significant improved. There will be no more work needed to do for humans,
        there will be only automatic left, so that people can rest and enjoy their own house. This system can also improve the security of the house, there will be no outsider can
        get inside the house, moreover, the owners are able to make fast contact to public services. This development will make a people change their perspectives about applying
        automatic robots into real life, make them realize that the ultimate goal of IoT and AI is to make our life easier. This SmartLife project will be the first step of the
        progress making everything become automatic.</p>
